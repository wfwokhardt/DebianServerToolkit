# Server Toolkit ( Debian/Ubuntu )
Debian Server Toolkit is a suite of scripts and programs written to create a minimum effort environment for backend engineers to maintain a server's updates and maintenece. 

This toolkit involves the use of .sh and python scripts to help the engineer or owner keep the latest security patches installed, and maintain security through up to date systems instead of obscurity ( which isn't security to begin with ). 


Thanks for considering wfwokhardt for all your backend needs! <3
